            <p><strong>Free Cash Flow to Firm Model:</strong>
FCFF valuation is a method of estimating the intrinsic value of an asset based on the present value of its expected cash flows. To use DCF, an analyst needs to estimate the asset's life, cash flows, and the discount rate. DCF valuation is less influenced by market moods and perceptions, and it forces investors to think about the underlying characteristics of the firm. However, DCF valuation requires more explicit inputs and information than other methods, and the inputs can be noisy and manipulated. It works best for assets that generate cash flows, and for investors who have a long-term horizon, are capable of providing a catalyst for price to move to value, and are not swayed by market movements.

<br><br><strong>Excess Return Model:</strong>
Excess Return Models focus on the present value of expected excess returns that a firm is expected to generate in the future, in addition to the capital invested currently in the firm. Although it is challenging to calculate the total invested capital in Financial Service firms, this model can still be applied to value equity in such firms by focusing solely on equity. The value of equity in a financial service firm can be determined by adding the equity capital invested currently to the present value of expected excess returns to equity investors from current and future investments. This model's emphasis on excess returns is noteworthy as it differentiates between firms that earn just the fair-market rate of return on their equity investments and those that earn a below-market return, which would result in their equity market value dipping below the equity capital currently invested. Additionally, this model considers expected future investments, making it necessary for the analyst using the model to forecast both where the financial service firm will direct its future investments and the expected returns on those investments.

<br><br><strong>Relative Valuation:</strong>
Relative valuation is an approach that estimates the value of an asset by comparing it to the prices of similar or comparable assets in the market. This valuation method requires an identical or similar asset, a standardized measure of value, and variables to control for differences. Relative valuation is advantageous as it reflects market perceptions and moods, and is tailored to the needs of portfolio managers who are judged based on how they perform on a relative basis. However, relative valuation assumes that markets are correct in the aggregate, and may require implicit assumptions about other variables. Relative valuation works best when there are a large number of comparable assets priced in a market and a common variable can be used to standardize the price. This approach is suitable for investors with short time horizons, who are judged based on a relative benchmark and can take actions to exploit relative mispricing.</p>

              <p>Risk tolerance refers to the degree of uncertainty or variability that an investor or a company is willing to accept in their investment decisions. When considering the best, base, and worst cases in valuation, risk tolerance is a crucial factor that affects the valuation approach.

In general, the best, base, and worst cases refer to different scenarios that may occur in the future. These scenarios are typically based on different assumptions, such as different levels of economic growth, interest rates, or market conditions. The best case assumes a positive outcome, while the worst case assumes a negative outcome. The base case is typically a more realistic scenario that falls somewhere between the best and worst cases.

When valuing a company or investment in the context of best, base, and worst cases, the risk tolerance of the investor or company will affect the valuation approach. A more risk-averse investor or company may place more weight on the worst-case scenario and apply a higher discount rate to reflect the higher risk associated with that scenario. On the other hand, a more risk-tolerant investor or company may place more weight on the best-case scenario and apply a lower discount rate to reflect the potentially higher returns associated with that scenario.

In practice, the approach to valuing a company or investment in the context of best, base, and worst cases will depend on the specific circumstances of the investment and the preferences of the investor or company. A thorough analysis of the potential risks and rewards associated with each scenario is essential to arrive at a fair and accurate valuation that reflects the investor or company's risk tolerance.</p>

          <p>We generally set the investment horizon based on the Valuation Methods outcome and the Cost of Equity:<br><br>
              <strong>Low cost of equity and overvalued:</strong> This scenario is potentially risky for investors as the asset is overvalued, meaning its current market price is higher than its intrinsic value. However, the low cost of equity could provide a boost to returns in the short term, as investors may be willing to pay a premium for the asset due to low interest rates. Over the long term, the asset's overvaluation could lead to a price correction, resulting in lower returns for investors.

<br><br><strong>Low cost of equity and undervalued:</strong> This scenario presents a potentially attractive opportunity for investors. The asset is undervalued, meaning its current market price is lower than its intrinsic value, which could provide a margin of safety for investors. The low cost of equity could also help boost returns in the short term. Over the long term, as the market recognizes the asset's true value, the price could rise, resulting in higher returns for investors.

<br><br><strong>High cost of equity and overvalued:</strong> This scenario is potentially problematic for investors. The asset is overvalued, and the high cost of equity could make it difficult to justify the premium price. This could lead to a price correction in the short term, resulting in lower returns for investors.

<br><br><strong>High cost of equity and undervalued:</strong> This scenario presents a potentially attractive opportunity for investors. The asset is undervalued, meaning its current market price is lower than its intrinsic value, which could provide a margin of safety for investors. However, the high cost of equity could result in lower returns in the short term, as investors may be hesitant to pay the premium price. Over the long term, as the market recognizes the asset's true value, the price could rise, resulting in higher returns for investors.

It is important to note that these are general scenarios, and actual returns could vary depending on a variety of factors, including market conditions, industry trends, and company-specific factors. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions.
